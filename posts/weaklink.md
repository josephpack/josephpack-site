I don’t watch a lot of TV.

But a friend recommended I watch Down Cemetery Road, a new series on Apple TV with Ruth Wilson and Emma Thompson as he said it contained an interesting marketing lesson.

After watching it, I have to admit he was right!

One of the actors who plays a senior figure in the government was clearly told to ‘be very evil’. But his acting is so horrific, over doing his ‘evilness’ to the point of hilarity, that he ruins every scene he’s in and degrades the tone of the show. He’d be better cast in a shyt comicbook series.

Emma Thompson and Ruth Wilson are spectacular. But when this dork’s on screen you’re immediately sucked out of the story. Suddenly you’re looking around for the remote to get him off your screen.

Anyway, the point is thus:

When potential customers doubt the claims you’re making even a superb product can look, well, shyt.

Every step in the buying experience matters. Don’t over promise in your copy. Or scrimp when building relationships with new clients. They’ll smell something’s off from a mile away.
