I read the following in an online forum full of productivity geeks.

Not the sort of place I hang out. Full of people optimising the living shyt out of every last morsel of life. Not my style frankly. But occasionally I’ll dip in there to see if the geeks have anything useful to say.

On this occasion a thread slapped me right between the eyebrows.

Anyway, he goes:

\===

“Over the past 3 years, I've meditated almost every single morning—and along the way, I've:

Learned to do deeply focused work for 3 hours a day

Gained a clarity and calmness I've never felt

Become more present throughout my day

Start meditating tomorrow morning and you'll be unrecognizable in a year.”

\===

I couldn’t agree more.

But most people NEVER get to realise how true this fellas’ words are.

Because most people give up way before any meaningful gains are realised.

And part of the problem is because most people are taught to meditate by woo-woo spiritual types who claim it’s the only way to reach a state of enlightenment. Whatever that means.

Meditation has been woo-washed by goo-roos the world over so driven types won’t touch it. They think its only benefit is for dancing around a stone circle chanting mantras and worshipping the moon gods.

But meditation is so much more than that.

Meditation has been proven, beyond any reasonable doubt, to improve the attention span. It will literally improve the functioning of the prefrontal cortex – the brain region, as I wrote in an earlier email, that rots when we spend too much time on our phones.

In fact:

I’ve been teaching meditation to people with ADHD for years. People who’d rather stick needles through their testicles than sit in silence for 15 minutes.

And I won’t lie to you, at times it was tough.

But most of ‘em manage it.
